# Lab: Testing using Vitest

## Overview
Now that you have covered creating a testing suite, we can use the key principles of test-driven development to work with an existing app. Normally, you would build the testing while developing, but you were recently brought onto this project to add a testing suite! You are working to implement a testing suite for a banking application that allows users to track their expenditures by submitting and searching through them.

## Task 1: Define the Problem
- Build a testing suite for an existing application.

## Task 2: Determine the Design
- Identify the key features of this project.

## Task 3: Develop the Code
- One feature needs to be completed: the search functionality.

## Task 4: Test and Refine
- Build a test suite using Vitest to test key features:
  - Display transactions
  - Add transactions
  - Search transactions and sort transactions

## Task 5: Document and Maintain
- Commit as you go, writing meaningful commit messages.
- Push commit history to GitHub periodically and when the lab is complete.

## Tools and Resources
- Vitest: [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/)

## Instructions

### Set Up
Before we begin coding, let's complete the initial setup for this lesson:

#### Fork and Clone
1. Go to the provided GitHub repository link.
2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

#### Open and Run File
1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

### Instructions
#### Task 1: Define the Problem
- Build a testing suite for an existing application.

#### Task 2: Determine the Design
- Identify the key features of this project.

#### Task 3: Develop, Test, and Refine the Code

1. Open the React application in the browser:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Run the included backend:
   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```
3. Create a test branch.

#### Display Transactions Test
- Create a test suite that will test if transactions are displayed on startup.

#### Add Transactions Test
- Create a test suite that will test:
  - If new transactions are added to the frontend.
  - If a POST request was called.

#### Search Transactions and Sort Transactions Test
- Create a test suite that will test:
  - If a change event is triggered, the page updates accordingly.
  - Search is incomplete, so build out the search functionality based on the test.

4. Push the feature branch and open a PR on GitHub.
5. Merge to `main`.

### Task 4: Document and Maintain
#### Best Practice Documentation Steps:
- Add comments to the code to explain purpose and logic.
- Clarify intent/functionality of code for other developers.
- Add screenshots of completed work included in Markdown in `README.md`.
- Update `README.md` to reflect the functionality of the application following [Make a README](https://makeareadme.com).
- Delete any stale branches on GitHub.
- Remove unnecessary/commented-out code.
- If needed, update `.gitignore` to remove sensitive data.

### Submission
- Once the test suite is built, submit the link to the GitHub repository on Canvas.

### Grading Criteria
- The application has test suites.
- The application tests if transactions display on load.
- The application tests if a new transaction can be added.
- The application tests if search functionality updates the page correctly.

React Testing Lab · Bank Transactions

This is a simple banking app I built for Flatiron’s Module 7 testing lab. It pulls in transactions, lets me add a new one, and gives me quick search and sort tools. The tests use Vitest with React Testing Library and mock the network calls, so I can move fast without a real backend running during tests.

No emojis. No comments in code.

What it does

Shows transactions on page load from GET /transactions

Lets me add a transaction with a small form that sends POST /transactions

Filters by search (matches description or category)

Sorts by amount and by date in both directions

Comes with a test suite that checks display, add flow, search, and sort
